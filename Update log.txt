I started this update log at the 1.8 release, so sorry if it doesnt have anything before 1.8

Version 1.8 Beta v1
Updated the mod to version 1.8, Minecraft 1.8. Also changed the way that Euca generates started.
Made the mobs names have no spaces for their registry (So you can use the /summon command)
