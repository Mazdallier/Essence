Essence
=======
I, Brock Kerley (The_SlayerMC), have stolen code and/or resources with no permissions from BossLetsPlays, DivineRPG, Xycraft, and AE2. I had lied about it and avoided punishment, causing all the drama that occured throughout the weeks of November 10th and 17th 2014. I have removed the stolen code/resources as of Essence version - 1.7.10 1.4. I would like to publicly appologize to everyone for my acts.
